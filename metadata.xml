    <description>Adds NLSS themed items to the game! So far this mod includes 29 all new items, 1 new trinket and 1 new pill effect! Feedback / bug reports are always appreciated!

If you want easy access to all new items, there's a variable called PREVIEW_ITEMS at the top of the main.lua file. Just turn that variable from false to true, and all items will spawn when you start a run!
